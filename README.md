# django-template-blocks1

THIS IS A SOLO CLASSWORK

Use your previous movie app and base html files. Create template blocks for your header and footer in your base.html file. Create a new page called newIndex that changes your header, footer, and provides a different look of the data in your database. Call this page via a different route.

Extra work:
On a side panel on your page, include only movie names.

<strong>DO NOT</strong> use other students as help until they are finshed with their classwork. Use instructions provided by the tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) as a starting point.
